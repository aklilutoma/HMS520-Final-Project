# HMS520-Final-Project Proposal by Aklilu Toma Shamenna
Format choosed: Format3-Analyzing a dataset that uses data wrangling and modeling tools in R
Goal of the project: 
1. To conduct exploratory data analysis to check  whether multiple 
linear regression model is a good choice for predicting bike rental demand.
2. To train multiple linear regression model and test its performance 
for predicting bike rental demand.
Data: Bike sharing data 
 [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/data]

The data was generated by bike sharing systems (recording data on 
duration of travel, departure  location, 
arrival location, and time elapsed)



Detailed plans and timeline

Phase 1: Project Planning and Setup (11/24-11/28)
Define the objectives of the project.
Set up the working environment (R Studio and packages).
Download and import the bike share data from Kaggle webcite 

Phase 2: Data Exploration and Preprocessing (11/29-12/03)
Understand the structure of the data
Visualize the data to detect patterns, trends, and outliers,
perform EDA (correlation and feature selection)

Phase 3: Model building and evaluation (12/04-12/07)
Split the data into training and test sets, build and evaluate a regression model

Phase 4: Reporting and Presentation (12/08-12/10)
Prepare a report on the findings from the EDA and model evaluation.
Prepare a presentation summarizing the key findings

Phase 5: Project Submission and presentation (12/09-12/15)
Submiting the project report and presenting the findings
Geting feedbacks from reviewers
